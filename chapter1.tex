\section{Background of the Study}

Accurate weight estimation in livestock is crucial for effective farm management, as it directly impacts feed optimization, breeding decisions, health assessment, and overall animal welfare \citep{wang2024review}. Proper weight management allows farmers to adjust feeding schedules, monitor growth, and make timely decisions that contribute to better productivity and profitability. Traditional weight measurement methods, primarily through the use of weighing scales, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and stressful for animals, which can result in reduced productivity, increased risk of injury, and negative effects on animal welfare \citep{faucitano2018transport}. The high cost, operational complexity, and maintenance requirements of these weighing systems further limit their practicality, especially for small and medium-sized farms \citep{dickinson2013automated}.

To address these challenges, researchers have developed indirect approaches that utilize morphometric measurements and image features to estimate body weight without the need for direct handling. These methods involve manual measurements with simple tools or the use of advanced electro-optical devices, such as 2D cameras, 3D imaging systems, and infrared sensors \citep{wang2024review}. While these technologies can offer more convenient alternatives to direct weighing, they also have limitations, such as high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and potential inaccuracies in dynamic and variable farm environments \citep{terence2024systematic}. These factors have hindered the widespread adoption of such technologies, particularly among smallholder farmers who operate on limited budgets.

The growing use of computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) in agriculture has significantly enhanced the accuracy, efficiency, and automation of livestock weight estimation systems \citep{gjergji2020deep}. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of depth sensors, such as Microsoft's Kinect, in capturing detailed 3D data that can be used to estimate animal body weight with high precision \citep{pezzuolo2018barn}. Compared to traditional monocular or complex multi-camera systems, Kinect sensors are relatively affordable and user-friendly, making them a practical solution for smaller farms. However, there remains a gap in fully utilizing Kinect's depth-sensing capabilities to create a reliable, scalable, and low-cost system for estimating livestock weight in a non-invasive manner.

This study aims to address this gap by leveraging the Kinect sensor for accurate weight estimation in pigs. By utilizing Kinect's depth-sensing technology, this research seeks to develop a solution that not only improves estimation accuracy but also minimizes stress on animals and reduces labor requirements. Unlike previous approaches that rely on more expensive and complex setups, a Kinect-based system has the potential to be easily adopted by small and medium-sized farmers, offering a cost-effective tool that enhances weight monitoring, optimizes feeding strategies, and ultimately improves overall farm productivity and animal welfare. The findings of this research could pave the way for broader applications of depth-sensing technologies in livestock farming, contributing to the ongoing transition toward precision agriculture and smart farming practices.

\section{Statement of the Problem}

Accurate and efficient weight calculation in pig farming is crucial for optimizing feeding strategies, monitoring growth, and making informed management decisions \citep{pezzuolo2018barn}. Proper weight monitoring directly impacts the productivity and profitability of pig farming operations as it affects key decisions such as health monitoring and determining the optimal time for the market. However, traditional methods, such as manual weighing, are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and stressful for the animals, potentially impacting their well-being and productivity \citep{li2014estimation}. Manual weighing involves physically moving pigs to weighing scales which not only causes stress for the animals but also requires significant labor resources and poses safety risks for the handlers. This highlights the need for alternative approaches that are non-invasive, automated, and cost-effective.

While some investigations have explored imaging techniques for pig weight estimation, most existing studies have primarily focused on traditional monocular vision or single-camera systems \citep{pezzuolo2018barn}\citep{kollis2007weight}. These systems are often limited by their inability to capture depth information accurately which is crucial for estimating body volume and weight. Furthermore, traditional imaging methods may be prone to inaccuracies due to variations in lighting conditions, pig movement, and occlusion.

Recent advancements in multi-camera systems have shown promise in improving the accuracy of livestock weight estimation \citep{dohmen2022computer}. These multi-camera setups can provide more precise three-dimensional (3D) information, as a result enhancing the precision of weight estimation. Nevertheless, the complexity and cost associated with setting up and maintaining multiple cameras pose significant barriers to widespread adoption in commercial pig farming. The need for specialized equipment and significant computational ability makes such systems impractical for farmers, especially those with limited resources. 
Moreover, the weight of pigs and other livestock has been estimated by previous studies using a range of modeling techniques, including machine learning algorithms and linear and nonlinear functions. Although these approaches have demonstrated promise, their accuracy is frequently hampered by the quality of the input data coming from 2D photos or crude 3D reconstructions, particularly in cases when animal postures or occlusions vary.

Despite this progress made in imaging-based weight estimation, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the full utilization of  Kinect’s depth-sensing capabilities for weight estimation, which could offer a more practical and precise solution. Kinect cameras provide a unique opportunity to capture accurate 3D data without the need for complex multi-camera setups. It is relatively affordable, capable of capturing high-quality depth information, and easy to use, making it a practical solution for weight estimation in pig farming.

This research aims to bridge that gap by leveraging the Kinect system to capture depth image data for weight estimation in pigs. Unlike previous approaches, the Kinect-based system offers the potential to reduce reliance on complex, multi-camera setups while improving estimation accuracy. By providing detailed depth information, Kinect technology can enable more precise body volume measurements. The development of an automated, non-invasive, and cost-effective Kinect-based system could transform weight monitoring in pig farming, making it accessible even to smaller-scale farmers.

\section{Scope and Limitations}

This research will focus on the estimation of weight in Landrace pigs using the Kinect sensor under controlled conditions(height, posture, and lighting). The scope is limited to analyzing data collected from pigs of this specific breed, and the study will not generalize results to other pig varieties. Additionally, only pigs with a straight posture will be considered, as posture may affect the accuracy of the sensors. Pigs in other positions or with varied postures will not be considered. Environmental conditions, such as lighting and background, will be maintained as constant as possible, and while these factors may influence the sensor's accuracy, their impact will not be the subject of in-depth analysis. 

The system developed in this research will employ batch processing of the collected data, meaning that real-time monitoring or continuous data acquisition is beyond the scope of this study. Instead, the data will be gathered and analyzed after the fact, limiting the immediate applicability of the system in dynamic, real-world farming environments.
